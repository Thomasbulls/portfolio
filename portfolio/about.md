## My Journey  :books:
`Key words: passion, design skills, York University, Startups`

Before I became a full-stack developer, I had a passion for Magazine Design in high school and Cinematic Video Production ([Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCrs_RN_QteNtzQSt0ebY-QA)):camera:. My previous hobbies played a crucial role in honing my creativity and design skills, which I now utilize to craft user-friendly and visually appealing web applications. I am also a gamer  :video_game:, with a deep love for computers and design, which eventually led me to become a developer. 

After I graduated from York University, I joined a bootcamp to learn more about full-stack development. I built two big online store projects from scratch during this time. I also started freelancing, where I helped companies build websites and gave them advice. I made sure they were satisfied with the work I did and always provided my services beyond expectations. 
## Freelance and Bootcamp Experience
`Key words: real-world experience, freelancing`

During my academic journey, I seized every opportunity to gain real-world experience. I participated in a rigorous full-stack development bootcamp, where I further honed my skills and gained hands-on experience in building end-to-end web applications. This invaluable experience solidified my passion for development. 

Through freelancing, I have had the privilege of working with diverse clients on various projects. Not only has this provided me with practical experience in managing projects independently, but it has also allowed me to turn my passion into a profitable venture. It's truly rewarding to bring clients' visions to life and witness the impact of my work on their businesses.

Our Project: ([AITok](https://chat.aitok.us/chat/new))

I had the privilege of joining a startup, based in Cupertino, California, which comprises a team of 13 professionals, where I work remotely as a fullstack engineer. Engaging in full-time commitment, our collective objective was to develop an application tailored to Chinese users, enabling them to harness ChatGPT's capabilities while extending its functionality.

Within this role, my responsibilities encompassed a range of pivotal tasks, including integrating `third-party APIs` that facilitate the parsing of PDF and Word documents, empowering users to pose inquiries rooted in their file uploads. To ensure a secure and respectful user experience, I implemented mechanisms to `filter out sensitive vocabulary` from search inputs. My contribution extended to addressing UI inconsistencies and rectifying any encountered bugs,
